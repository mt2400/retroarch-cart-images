Images of game carts / discs to use on xmb menu instead of game logos for RetroArch

## How To Use

Update RetroArch to 1.20.0

Download the image files from this repo

Open your RetroArch directory, and go to thumbnails, the conosole/playlist you want, and open the Named_Logos folder - this is where we will place the images

If the Named_Logos folder doesnt exist, create one

**Example:** C:\RetroArch-Win64\thumbnails\Sony - PlayStation\Named_Logos

If you have any roms with other revisions, etc - change the file name to match ex: "Die Hard Trilogy (USA) (Rev 1).png"

Now open up RetroArch with xmb as your menu theme and navigate to Settings > Appearance > Playlist Icons and select "Content Logo"

Restart RetroArch and your games will now show each unique cart/disc image instead of a generic icon
